# Hangman Challenge


I decided to do a web version of hangman in the Flutter framework for this project. 


It took me about 3 Hours and 30 Minutes.


# TO RUN WEBPAGE:


-Clone the repository


-navigate in terminal to the 'runtime' folder of this repository


-run a python http server with 'python -m http.server 8000' (or whatever port instead of 8000')


-type 'localhost:8000' in chrome and hit return


-enjoy!



# Source Code:


The source code is located in 'lib'. Most of the code is in 'HangmanView.dart', but the other 3 .dart files are important side files as well.
